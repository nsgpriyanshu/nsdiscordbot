## Project Overview

This Discord bot is designed to interact with users on Discord servers by responding to commands and events. It features a flexible command handling system and robust error handling to ensure reliability.

## Features

- **Slash Commands**: Supports multiple slash commands organized in directories.
- **Message Commands**: Handles traditional text commands.
- **Event Handling**: Listens to and processes various Discord events.
- **Error Handling**: Logs and reports errors to a specified channel.
- **Configuration Management**: Uses environment variables for sensitive information.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed (preferably the latest LTS version).
- **Discord.js**: This project uses Discord.js v14.
- **A Discord Bot Token**: Obtain a bot token from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nsgpriyanshu/nsdiscordbot.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd your-discord-bot-repo
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

1. **Create a `.env` File** in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:
   ```env
   BOT_TOKEN=your-discord-bot-token
   BOT_ID=your-discord-bot-id
   ERROR_CHANNEL=your-error-log-channel-id
   DEVELOPER_IDS=comma-separated-list-of-developer-ids
   ```

2. **Update `botConfig.js`** with the appropriate configuration values:
   ```js
   module.exports = {
     BOT_TOKEN: process.env.BOT_TOKEN,
     BOT_ID: process.env.BOT_ID,
     ERROR_CHANNEL: process.env.ERROR_CHANNEL,
     DEVELOPER_IDS: process.env.DEVELOPER_IDS.split(','),
   };
   ```

## Running the Bot

1. **Start the Bot**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Command and Event Structure

- **Commands**: Commands are located in the `src/commands` directory. Commands are separated into `slashCommands` and `messageCommands` subdirectories.
- **Events**: Event handlers are located in the `src/events` directory. They include interaction events and message events.

### Example Command File (`ping.js`)

```js
const { SlashCommandBuilder } = require('discord.js');

module.exports = {
  data: new SlashCommandBuilder()
    .setName('ping')
    .setDescription('Replies with Pong!'),
  async execute(interaction) {
    await interaction.reply('Pong!');
  },
};
```

### Example Event File (`messageCreate.js`)

```js
const { EmbedBuilder } = require('discord.js');
const { COLORS, EMOJIS } = require('../constants/botConst');

module.exports = {
  name: 'messageCreate',
  execute(message) {
    // Event logic for message creation
  },
};
```
